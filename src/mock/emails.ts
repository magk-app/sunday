I have also uninstalled and reinstalled the application, restarted my computer, and confirmed that my system is fully up to date, yet the issue persists.\n\nCould you please advise on any additional troubleshooting steps or let me know if there is a known resolution for this behavior? I am happy to share any log files or system information you may need to diagnose the problem.\n\nSincerely,\nJack Luo`,
