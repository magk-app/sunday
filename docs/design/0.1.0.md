# Design 0.1.0

## Summary
Initial project setup for SundayL, focused on establishing the technical foundation, documentation, and basic scaffolding for future development. This version is about enabling rapid iteration and clear project direction.

## Architecture
- **Framework:** Next.js (TypeScript) for frontend and routing.
- **UI:** Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for modern, composable UI components.
- **Structure:**
  - `/src/app` for main app logic and routing.
  - `/components` for reusable UI components.
  - `/lib` for utility functions and service clients.
  - `/types` for TypeScript type definitions.
  - `/mock` for mock data (emails, threads, people, projects).

## Key Tasks Completed
- Initialized Next.js app with TypeScript configuration.
- Installed and configured Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui.
- Created project structure with all major folders.
- Added mock data for emails, threads, people, and projects.
- Implemented main layout with header, sidebar, and navigation (no real data, just placeholders).
- Created placeholder pages for Email List, Tinder View, Knowledge Base, and Settings.
- Wrote comprehensive documentation:
  - `README.md` (vision, stack, setup)
  - `docs/execution/plan.md` (development plan)
  - `docs/ui-spec.md` (UI/UX specifications)
  - `docs/execution/bugs.md` (bug tracking)

## Limitations
- No real data or backend integration; all features are mock/stubbed.
- No authentication or persistent storage beyond local mocks.
- No actual email, AI, or workflow logic implemented yet.

## Version Notes
- This version is strictly foundational and does not include any user-facing features beyond static scaffolding and navigation.
