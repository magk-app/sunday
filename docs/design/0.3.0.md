# Design 0.3.0

## Summary
Version 0.3.0 is the "real data" milestone. The focus is on connecting SundayL to live data sources (Supabase and Gmail), enabling persistent storage, and introducing advanced workflow and project management features. This version transitions the app from a mock-driven MVP to a functional, data-driven assistant.

## Key Features & Tasks

### 1. Supabase Integration
- Connect to Supabase database for persistent storage.
- Store emails, threads, and knowledge base entries in Supabase.
- Replace mock data with real database queries throughout the app.
- Implement CRUD operations for emails, threads, and knowledge base.

### 2. Gmail API Integration
- Connect to Gmail API for fetching emails (OAuth2 workflow).
- Retrieve emails, parse and store in Supabase.
- (Optional) Implement email sending via Gmail API.
- Handle OAuth consent and token refresh securely.

### 3. Gmail MCP Server Integration
- Connect to Gmail MCP server for advanced actions (sync, workflow).
- Implement MCP protocol for email actions (approve, reject, archive, etc.).
- Enable cross-platform sync and workflow automation.

### 4. AI-Powered Email Composition
- Add "Compose Email" feature in the UI.
- Integrate AI to help draft emails, search online for information, and suggest content.
- UI for composing, editing, and sending emails.

### 5. Project Management Area
- Create a project/task management dashboard (inspired by ClickUp).
- Link emails and threads to projects/tasks.
- Track status, deadlines, and assignments for each task.

### 6. Sorting & Filtering
- Implement sorting and filtering for the email list:
  - By importance (urgent, high, medium, low)
  - By status (pending, approved, rejected)
  - By sender, date, project, etc.
- Define sorting/filtering UI and logic.

### 7. User Authentication
- Research and implement authentication (NextAuth.js with Google provider recommended).
- Set up Google Cloud OAuth credentials.
- Protect routes and user data.

## Bug Fixes & Improvements

### 1. Database-Driven Sync
- All email threads and replies are now synced via the database.
- Fix issues with status workflow and multi-object sync.
- Ensure real-time updates across all clients.

### 2. Workflow Actions
- Approving an email sends it (via Gmail API).
- Rejecting an email discards the draft and archives the thread (but keeps it accessible).
- Ensure status updates and UI reflect backend state.

## UI/UX Enhancements (from UI Spec)
- Refine email list and Tinder View for real data.
- Add search bar and advanced filters.
- Improve project/task management UI.
- Enhance notifications and status indicators.

## Tasks (from plan.md and UI spec)
- [ ] Set up Supabase tables and integrate with frontend.
- [ ] Implement Gmail OAuth and API integration.
- [ ] Build project/task management dashboard.
- [ ] Add AI-powered compose feature.
- [ ] Implement sorting/filtering in email list.
- [ ] Add authentication and protect sensitive routes.
- [ ] Refactor status workflow for database sync.
- [ ] Ensure all actions (approve/reject/send) are fully functional and reflected in UI.

## Version Notes
- This version marks the transition to a real, persistent, and collaborative email assistant.
- Focus on reliability, data integrity, and advanced workflow features.
- Sets the stage for future integrations (Notion, Slack, etc.) and advanced AI features.
