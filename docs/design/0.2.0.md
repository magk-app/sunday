# Design 0.2.0

## Summary
First major sprint: built a functional MVP with interactive UI, mock data workflows, and the beginnings of AI-powered features. The focus was on user experience, workflow, and preparing for real data integration. All data is currently mocked; no backend or real API integration yet.

## Features Implemented

### Email List (Threaded)
- Displays emails grouped by conversation thread.
- Each thread shows:
  - Subject, participants, message count, last message time.
  - Status tags: pending, approved, rejected.
  - Importance indicator: urgent, high, medium, low (mocked, not AI-classified).
  - AI summary badge if summary is present (mocked, not real AI call).
  - Star (important) toggle; threads can be filtered by Inbox, Important, Approved, Rejected.
- Clicking a thread selects it for detail view.

### Tinder View
- Card-based interface for triaging emails one at a time.
- Supports swipe gestures and manual buttons for:
  - Approve (marks thread as approved, draft as sent)
  - Reject (deletes draft, marks thread as rejected)
  - Edit (inline editing of draft reply)
  - Save to Knowledge Base (stores thread/person/project in local storage)
- Progress indicator shows how many emails are left to review.
- Visual feedback for actions (animations, toasts).
- Synchronizes state with main app via localStorage events.

### AI Draft Reply Generation
- Generates AI-powered draft replies for selected threads using OpenAI API (mocked, not real API call).
- Tracks token usage and cost (mocked values), displayed in the Settings page.
- Allows only one pending draft per thread; new generations replace previous pending drafts.

### Status Bar & Notifications
- Shows current workflow step and status (e.g., Reviewing, Approved, Rejected).
- Displays toasts for actions (approve/reject, save to KB, errors).

### Knowledge Base
- Sidebar and dedicated page for viewing people and projects extracted from emails (mocked data).
- Modal popups for person/project details.
- Allows manual addition of people/projects to the knowledge base (local storage only).

### Settings Page
- Profile management (name, email, avatar URL) saved to local storage.
- OpenAI API key management (local storage only).
- Usage analytics: total tokens, estimated cost, and discounted cost (50% Sunday Surfaces discount).

### UI/UX Improvements
- Modern, responsive design using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components.
- Sidebar navigation for folders (Inbox, Important, Approved, Rejected).
- Improved card/list layouts, avatars, and badges.
- Loading states and visual feedback for actions.

## Bug Fixes (from 0.1.0)
- Fixed Tailwind CSS not loading due to missing import in layout.tsx.
- Resolved shadcn/ui installation dependency conflicts by temporarily removing incompatible packages.
- Added missing `cn` utility function to prevent runtime errors in shadcn/ui components.
- Fixed Next.js chunk loading errors by clearing the build cache after refactor.
- Implemented thread-based grouping to prevent individual emails from showing separately.
- Added visual feedback (toasts, loading states) for approve/reject actions.
- Fixed synchronization issues between Tinder View and main app by listening to localStorage events.
- Improved token usage and cost tracking for AI reply generation and improvements.

## Limitations
- All data is currently mocked; no real database or Gmail API integration yet.
- Knowledge base and settings are local-only (no backend persistence).
- Approve/Reject actions only update local state; no real email sending or archiving.
- No authentication or user management.

## Version Notes
- This version delivers a fully interactive, mock-driven MVP with a focus on workflow, usability, and visual polish, but does not yet connect to any real backend or external APIs.
