- **Date Found**: 2025-06-24
- **Severity**: High
- **Status**: Unresolved
- **Description**: Integration between `langchain` and `googleapis` fails due to incompatible versions, preventing use of Google API features in LangChain workflows.

- **Actions Taken**:
  - Attempted to use both packages together; encountered runtime and install errors.
  - Searched for compatible versions and checked changelogs.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Consider downgrading `googleapis` to `^126.0.1` if `langchain` is required.
  - Monitor for updates from either package that resolve the conflict.
  - Test integration after version changes.

- **Actions Taken**:
  - Attempted `npm install langgraph@^0.0.20` and received 404 error.
  - Checked npm registry and official docs ([see here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/)).

## ‚úÖ Completed Bugs & Feature Changes

#### Tailwind CSS Not Working Initially
- **Date Found**: 2025-06-24
- **Severity**: High
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Description**: Tailwind CSS styles were not being applied to components, resulting in unstyled UI.
- **Root Cause**: The `globals.css` file containing Tailwind directives was not imported in `layout.tsx`.
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Investigated missing styles in the browser.
  - Checked Tailwind config and build output.
  - Discovered missing import in `layout.tsx`.
- **Solution/Fix**: Created `src/app/globals.css` with Tailwind directives and imported it in `layout.tsx`.

#### shadcn/ui Installation Dependencies Conflict
- **Date Found**: 2025-06-24
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Status**: Fixed (workaround)
- **Description**: Unable to install shadcn/ui due to npm peer dependency conflict between `langchain@0.0.200` and `googleapis@128.0.0`.
- **Root Cause**: `langchain` expects `googleapis@^126.0.1`, but the project had `googleapis@128.0.0` installed, causing a version mismatch.
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Attempted `npm install` and received peer dependency errors.
  - Used `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to bypass, but not ideal.
  - Temporarily uninstalled `googleapis` to allow shadcn/ui installation.
- **Solution/Fix**: Uninstalled `googleapis`, installed shadcn/ui, and noted to reinstall a compatible version later.
- **Next Steps**: Re-install `googleapis` with a compatible version (`^126.0.1`) when needed for integration with `langchain`.

#### Missing `cn` Utility Function
- **Date Found**: 2025-06-24
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Description**: shadcn/ui components expect a `cn` utility function in `@/lib/utils`, causing runtime errors if missing.
- **Root Cause**: shadcn/ui CLI does not create the utils file automatically, and the function was not manually added.
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Noticed import errors in components using `cn`.
  - Reviewed shadcn/ui documentation and example projects.
- **Solution/Fix**: Created `src/lib/utils.ts` with a `cn` function using `clsx` and `tailwind-merge`.
- **Next Steps**: None needed; all components now import `cn` successfully.
