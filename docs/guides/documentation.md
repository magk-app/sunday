# Documentation Standards & Guidelines

## Purpose
This document defines the standards, structure, and best practices for writing and maintaining documentation in this codebase. It is designed to ensure clarity, consistency, and accessibility for all contributors and users, and to serve as the foundation for a Notion-like documentation hub.

---

## 1. Documentation Philosophy
- **Clarity**: Write for the next developer. Assume no prior context.
- **Brevity**: Be concise, but do not omit essential details.
- **Structure**: Use headings, lists, and tables for readability.
- **Versioned**: Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes.
- **Actionable**: Include examples, code snippets, and clear instructions.
- **Accessible**: Use plain language and avoid jargon where possible.

---

## 2. Documentation Types
- **Overview Docs**: High-level project, architecture, and workflow explanations.
- **How-To Guides**: Step-by-step instructions for common tasks.
- **Reference Docs**: API, config, and type definitions.
- **Decision Records**: Rationale for major technical or product decisions.
- **Changelogs**: Summaries of changes, releases, and migrations.
- **Execution Docs**: Bugs, plans, and sprint notes (see `docs/execution/`).

---

## 3. File & Folder Structure
- All documentation lives in the `docs/` folder, organized by topic.
- Execution-related docs (bugs, plans, sprints) go in `docs/execution/`.
- Each major feature or module should have its own subfolder or file.
- Use clear, descriptive filenames (e.g., `api-reference.md`, `setup-guide.md`).

**Example Structure:**
```
docs/
  standards.md
  overview.md
  ui-spec.md
  execution/
    bugs.md
    plan.md
    sprints.md
```

---

## 4. Best Practices
- Start each file with a summary and intended audience.
- Use consistent Markdown formatting (see template below).
- Document every config, environment variable, and public API.
- Use code blocks for examples and configuration.
- Add diagrams (Mermaid, images) where helpful.
- Keep a changelog or version history in each major doc.
- Add a TODO section for future improvements.

---

## 5. Documentation Template
```markdown
# [Title]

## Summary
Brief overview of the document's purpose and scope.

## Audience
Who should read this document?

## Details
- [ ] Main content, organized by headings
- [ ] Code/config examples
- [ ] Diagrams if needed

## Version History
- v0.1.0 (YYYY-MM-DD): Initial version

## TODO
- [ ] List of improvements or missing sections
```

---

## 6. Review & Maintenance
- All docs should be reviewed before merging.
- Outdated docs must be flagged and updated as part of code changes.
- Use PRs for major documentation updates.
- Encourage feedback and suggestions from all contributors.

---

## 7. Tools & Publishing
- Use a modern static documentation generator (see `docs/standards.md` for options like Docusaurus, Nextra, Docsify, MkDocs, etc.).
- Documentation should be viewable online and easy to navigate.
- Prefer tools that support Markdown, search, versioning, and custom themes.

# 9. Example Documentation for tsconfig.json
/**
 * ===============================
 * # tsconfig.json Documentation
 * ===============================
 * ## Summary
 * The `tsconfig.json` file is a crucial configuration file in a TypeScript project. It specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project. This file allows developers to customize the TypeScript compiler settings to suit the needs of their project.
 *
 * ## Detailed Documentation
 *
 * ### Compiler Options
 * - **target**: Specifies the ECMAScript target version. Common values are `es5`, `es6`, `es2015`, etc.
 * - **lib**: Specifies the library files to be included in the compilation. Examples include `dom`, `es6`, `dom.iterable`.
 * - **allowJs**: Allows JavaScript files to be compiled. Useful for gradually migrating a JavaScript project to TypeScript.
 * - **skipLibCheck**: Skips type checking of all declaration files (`.d.ts`). This can speed up the compilation process.
 * - **strict**: Enables all strict type-checking options. This is recommended for catching potential errors early.
 * - **noEmit**: Prevents the compiler from generating output files. Useful when you only want to perform type checking.
 * - **esModuleInterop**: Enables emit interoperability between CommonJS and ES Modules via `__importStar` and `__importDefault`.
 * - **module**: Specifies the module code generation. Common values are `commonjs`, `esnext`, `amd`, etc.
 * - **moduleResolution**: Determines how modules are resolved. Options include `node` and `classic`.
 * - **resolveJsonModule**: Allows importing modules with a `.json` extension.
 * - **isolatedModules**: Ensures that each file is treated as a separate module. Useful for projects using Babel.
 * - **jsx**: Specifies the JSX code generation. Options include `preserve`, `react`, `react-native`.
 * - **incremental**: Enables incremental compilation, which can improve build performance.
 * - **plugins**: Specifies plugins to be used during the compilation process.
 * - **baseUrl**: Specifies the base directory to resolve non-relative module names.
 * - **paths**: A series of entries which re-map imports to lookup locations relative to the `baseUrl`.
 *
 * ### Version History
 * - **0.1.1** (June 24th, 2024): Initial version with basic compiler options set for a Next.js project.
 *
 * ### TODO List
 * - [ ] Review and update the `target` option to ensure compatibility with the latest ECMAScript features.
 * - [ ] Consider enabling `strict` mode for better type safety.
 * - [ ] Evaluate the need for additional `lib` entries as the project evolves.
