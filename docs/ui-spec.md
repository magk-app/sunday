# Sunday MVP UI Spec Sheet

## Overview
This document describes the user interface for the Sunday MVP. The goal is to display emails fetched from the Gmail API, allow users to view details, and approve or reject emails in a simple workflow. The UI is modern, beautiful, and workflow-driven, using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui. Authentication is optional for MVP; use mock/local data if needed.
