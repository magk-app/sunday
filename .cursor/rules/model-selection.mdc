# Model Selection Guidelines

## Task-Based Model Selection

### SONNET 4 - Development & Building
- **Primary use**: Active development and feature implementation
- **Ideal for**: Building new components, implementing features, routine development tasks
- **Examples**: Creating new pages like email management, implementing UI components

### SONNET 3.5 - General Tasks
- **Primary use**: Well-rounded, general-purpose tasks
- **Ideal for**: Code refactoring, documentation updates, minor feature additions
- **Examples**: Updating [README.md](mdc:README.md), modifying existing components, general maintenance

### O3 - Complex Problem Solving
- **Primary use**: Complex problems requiring deep reasoning and bug investigation
- **Ideal for**: Difficult debugging, architectural decisions, performance optimization
- **Examples**: Resolving integration issues between [src/app/page.tsx](mdc:src/app/page.tsx) and [src/app/tinder/page.tsx](mdc:src/app/tinder/page.tsx)

### Gemini 2.5 - Refactoring
- **Primary use**: Code refactoring and optimization
- **Ideal for**: Restructuring components, improving code organization, pattern implementation
- **Examples**: Refactoring [src/lib/](mdc:src/lib) services, optimizing component structure

## Model Selection Criteria
- **Task complexity**: Match model capability to problem difficulty
- **Context requirements**: Consider token limits for large codebases
- **Reasoning depth**: Use O3 for problems requiring multi-step analysis
- **Speed requirements**: Use SONNET 3.5 for quick iterations
